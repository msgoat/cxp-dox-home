# Getting started with AWS Lambda

## Prerequisites

* You will need access to an AWS account.
* The [AWS CLI]() must be installed on your local machine.
* The [AWS SAM CLI]() must be installed on your local machine.
* Installing the AWS Toolkit Plugin for your favourite IDE is highly recommended.

## AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM)

The `AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM)` is an open-source framework which helps you 

* to develop and test AWS Lambdas on your local machine
* to build and deploy AWS Lambdas to AWS accounts

@see [AWS Serverless Applicaton Model](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/what-is-sam.html)

### HOW-TO install AWS SAM

There's an excellent [installation guide provided by AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html) about the installation of AWS SAM on your local machine.
Since we are using primarily Windows machines, you should follow the installation instructions for Windows.
Of course, you can install AWS SAM on a Window WSL2 Ubuntu as well.
