# From Dockerfile to Docker Container

This article introduces you to Docker terminology 
in general and to the development process from a Dockerfile to a running Docker container in particular.

## Getting familiar with Docker Speak - The Terminology

### Docker Image

A __Docker image__ is the *build time* representation of containerized software. It can be regarded as a snapshot of a 
Linux file system containing base operating system, the libraries you need to run your software (i.e. a Java Runtime or JRE) 
and your software (i.e. a Java Application Server with a deployed Java application or a simple Java JAR).

In most cases your Docker image will *inherit* from a __base Docker image__ which provides common functionality you
would like to reuse. Let's say you want to build a Docker image exposing a Java Runtime Environment (JRE): 
The base Docker image will contain a specific Linux distribution. Your own Docker image will add the JRE to it.

Docker images are created by running the __docker build__ command on a Dockerfile, some custom files you would like to
add your image and a base image you are going to inherit from.
   
Docker images may be shared via a common [Docker registry](#docker-registry): you can push a Docker image from your local machine to a central Docker registry to share
it with your colleagues. You can pull an existing Docker image from a central Docker registry to your local machine. 

A Docker image is identified by its unique identifier provided by Docker or its more human friendly fully qualified 
image name which consists of:

* a [Docker repository](#docker-repository) name
* a Docker image name
* a [Docker image tag](#docker-tag)

Docker images can be managed using the __docker image__ commands. 
   
### Docker Container

A __Docker container__ is the *run time* representation of containerized software: itÂ´s a native process running on the 
host operating system inside its own virtual network with access to its own view of a file system based on the 
blueprint provided by the associated [Docker image](#docker-image).

Transforming a Docker image into a running Docker container is actually a two-step process: first the container is 
created from an image (__docker create__), then the container is started (__docker start__). Both steps can be combined 
by using the __docker run__ command.

Upon container start, the containerized software inside the container can be configured via environment variables, 
container ports have to be mapped to host ports, and [Docker volumes](#docker-volume) or native files or directories may 
be mounted into the container file system.  

### Docker Registry
 
If you want to share [Docker images](#docker-image) with others, you need to use a remote __Docker registry__ which 
hosts remote [Docker repositories](#docker-repository). Sound's familiar? Well it should: a Docker registry is something 
like [GitHub](https://github.io) but for Docker repositories instead of git repositories.

The most popular Docker registry is [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/). However, most enterprises will maintain their
own private registries based on products like [Quay](https://quay.io/) or [Harbor](https://goharbor.io/) which may be accessible via internet but will require
authentication via __docker login__.

### Docker Repository

A __Docker repository__ is a remote location hosted at a [Docker registry](#docker-registry) where you can store versions
of a particular Docker image.

![](img/docker_repository.png)

You can push local Docker images to a remote Docker repository by running __docker push__, to pull a remote Docker image 
to your local cache you need to run __docker pull__. Sound's familiar? Well it should: a remote Docker repository is something like
a remote git repository only for Docker images instead of git-managed source code.

The name of the repository is part of the fully qualified name of a Docker image.

### Dockerfile

A __Dockerfile__ contains all build instructions to be executed during a Docker build. A complete reference of the build 
instructions a Dockerfile may contain is available through the official 
[Dockerfile reference](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/).

The Dockerfile is a mandatory input parameter for the __docker build__ command.

A good Dockerfile should always contain (all relevant Docker instructions mentioned in brackets):

* A fully qualified name of a Docker images it is based on. (__FROM__)
* A set of meaningful __labels__ which provide information about the Docker image you would like to build. (__LABEL__)
* Linux commands to add all __required libraries__ that your application needs to run (if not provided by the base image!). (__RUN__)
* Linux commands to add a __non-root user__ which actually executes the containerized software. (__USER__)
* __COPY__ commands for all files or directories you would like to copy into the image.
* A list of all __mounting points__ which your images exposes. (__VOL__)
* A list of all __ports__ which your image exposes. (__PORT__)
* A list of all __environment variables__ which can be used for container configuration upon start time. (__ENV__)
* A Docker __entrypoint__ which refers to a shell script to be executed when the container is started. (__ENTRYPOINT__)
* A default Docker __command__ to be passed to the entrypoint script when no other command was given.

### Docker Tag

A __Tag__ refers to a particular version of a [Docker image](#docker-image) and is part of the fully qualified name of 
a Docker image.
A single Docker image may be referred by multiple tags. 
Each Docker image at least contains the default tag __latest__ which refers to the most recent version of a Docker image.
If you do not specify a tag when addressing a particular Docker image, Docker implicitly uses tag __latest__.

Docker images are tagged while running __docker build__ but may be retagged using __docker tag__ on an existing Docker image.

### Docker Volume

A __Docker volume__ is a special volume managed by Docker which can be mounted at container start time into the file system
of a container. The lifecycle of a Docker volume is completely independent from the lifecycle of a Docker container. 
Thus, the content of a Docker volume is retained although the Docker container it was mounted to has been stopped or 
even deleted.

Mounting a volume to a container is often called __volume mapping__ or __volume binding__ in a Docker context.

Docker volumes may be shared among multiple running Docker containers.

Docker volumes are stored as blobs in the file system of the host operating system and cannot be read or written without
a running container. 

Docker volumes can be managed using the __docker volume__ commands. 

### Docker Port Mapping

A Docker container is running in its own virtual network to isolate it from the network of the underlying host operating
system and the virtual networks of other containers. Thus, a __container port__ used by the containerized application running
within the container must be explicitly mapped to a __host port__ visible to the host operating system, if you want
to access your containerized application. The containerized application does not know that the container port it listens to 
is mapped to a different host port and vice versa.

Docker port mapping allows you to run multiple containerized applications listening to the same container port (like 8080)
on the same host machine without having to change them. All you need to do is to map these container ports to different
host ports on the host machine, when you start the containers (like container port of application A 8080 to host port 18080 and container port
of application B 8080 to host port 28080). 

## Putting the Terminology into Context - The Process

Since we have learned a lot about Docker terminology by now, you probably want to know more about the ways to actually apply the terminology.
So here's the detailed view on a regular development process which transforms a [Dockerfile](#dockerfile) into a running [Docker container](#docker-container):

![](img/docker_dockerfile_2_container.png)

### Phase 1: Building a Docker Image

1\. Write a Dockerfile which is based on a Docker base image and add all instructions mentioned in [Dockerfile](#dockerfile).

2\. Store the Dockerfile in a source directory.

3\. Add a `docker-entrypoint.sh` script as a Docker entrypoint to the source directory.

!!! danger "Remember to use Unix line terminators on Windows" 
    Take care of the line terminators you use on all shell scripts you copy to the Docker image. The standard line terminators
    `CRLF` on Windows have to be replaced with Unix line terminators `LF` before you start the Docker build. Otherwise
    your container will never start!!!
    
4\. Add all application artifacts representing the application to containerize to the source directory as well.

5\. Run __docker build__ on the source directory which will store the newly built Docker image in your local image cache.

6\. Push the newly created Docker image to a [Docker repository](#docker-repository) using __docker push__.

### Phase 2: Running a Docker Container

7\. Run __docker run__ with the fully qualified name of the [Docker image](#docker-image), the [port mappings](#docker-port-mapping), 
the [volume mappings](#docker-volume) and the environment variable values. Docker will pull the requested Docker image, create a Docker container from it and start the
Docker container.

8\. Access your containerized application through the mapped host port.
